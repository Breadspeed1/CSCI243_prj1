============================= ASSIGNMENT REPORT ============================
Assignment name is: Wildfire
My name is: Aiden Voth

===== In what cases does the program run correctly?  =================
All of them, it appears.

===== In what cases does the program fail and how?  ==================
It does not.

===== If applicable, what were the extra credit results?  ============
Functional.

===== If applicable, describe how to run the extra credit.  ==========
You use the -Ln and -Dn for lightning and dampness settings respectively.

The lightning flag specifies the probability that on any given simulation step (0..100 default 0),
a lightning strike will occur. This strike occurs at a random location on the grid,
and if that location is occupied by a live tree it will begin to burn.

The dampness flag specifies a dampness value (0..100 default 0) which adds
an extra check to the spread functionality. Previously in order for a tree
to light on fire it would have to have an appropriate amount of neighbors burning,
and it would have to pass a random check of the lighting probability specified by the
-cN argument. Now with the dampness flag, it has to pass an additional check which is
just the inverse of the dampness property. (eg. dampness 100 will never light unless struck by lightning, and dampness 0 is as if the flag was not implemented)

===== How much time did I spend on the project?  =====================
A few hours.

===== What did I learn?  =============================================
Some terminal control commands.

===== What was easy in this assignment?  =============================
The simulation logic.

===== What gave me problems or troubles?  ============================
Text formatting.

===== What would be the most important improvement for the project?  =
Give more specific instructions for required output so that passing the
autograder isn't trial and error. Also please make it clear that we don't
have to match the reference implementation exactly.

===== What else would I have liked to do for this assignment?  =======
More extra credit.
